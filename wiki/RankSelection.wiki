#summary Giving more importance to recent estimates

= Introduction =

One issue with the previous method is all velocities are considered, which can be problematic when methodologies change. Let's say for example a new tool was introduced to increase productivity. In the long term everyone will get work done faster, but until ramp-up on the tool is complete, developers will be slowed down. Preparing a schedule with all previous estimates will dampen the new tool's impact and the schedule will possibly be infeasible. This can be fixed by using a weighted average giving more importance to recent estimates.


= Details =

The approach used in this prototype is to sort the estimates by date and distribute weights according to rank (i.e. the most recent has rank 1, the second 2 and the oldest _n_). Let's derive a function that maps rank to weight.

First we define the general structure of our function and set two constraints:
 * Have control over the probability ratio between the most recent and oldest member with _r_. For example setting _r=5_ means the most recent estimate will have a _5:1_ weight ratio against the oldest.
 * The area under the curve should be _1_. This will be useful later when we use this function for probabilities.

Let's start by solving for _k_ for later.

Now moving on to the area under the curve.

Multiplying by two on both sides will rid us of the fraction.

We may now solve for _a_.

Now that we have _a_ we may express _k_ without _a_.

Plugging _a_ and _k_ back into the generic function defined above gives us this:
