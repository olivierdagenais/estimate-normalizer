#summary Giving more importance to recent estimates

One issue with the previous method is all velocities are considered, which can be problematic when methodologies change. Let's say for example a new tool was introduced to increase productivity. In the long term everyone will get work done faster, but until ramp-up on the tool is complete, developers will be slowed down. Preparing a schedule with all previous estimates will dampen the new tool's impact and the schedule will possibly be infeasible. This can be fixed by using a weighted average giving more importance to recent estimates.


= Deriving the Weights =

The approach used in this prototype is to sort the estimates by date and distribute weights according to rank (i.e. the most recent has rank 1, the second 2 and the oldest _n_). Let's derive a function that maps rank to weight.

First we define the general structure of our function and set two constraints:
 * Have control over the probability ratio between the most recent and oldest member with _r_. For example setting _r=5_ means the most recent estimate will have a _5:1_ weight ratio against the oldest.
 * The area under the curve should be _1_. This will be useful later when we use this function for probabilities.

Let's start by solving for _k_ for later.

Now moving on to the area under the curve.

Multiplying by two on both sides will rid us of the fraction.

We may now solve for _a_.

Now that we have _a_ we may express _k_ without _a_.

Plugging _a_ and _k_ back into the generic function defined above gives us this:

You may see this in code [http://code.google.com/p/estimate-normalizer/source/browse/trunk/src/analysis/Analyzer.java#36 here].

= What it looks like =

Setting _n=10_ (the total number of estimates) and _r=5_ (the most recent having a 5:1 ratio against the oldest) we get this graph with these data points.

= Using the Equation =

Previously we simply calculated the average velocity as follows:

With the weight function, we do it this way instead:

Note that we don't need to divide by anything as the weight function is already normalized, one of the nice things about enforcing the area under the curve to be one!
